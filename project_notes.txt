MVPs
Render a game board in the browser
!Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
!Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
!Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
!Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
